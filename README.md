# Automating Git using Shell Script
  This script is aimed for automating your workflowe to git by just executing the script
  
  ## How it's works:
  You just need to clone the script into the "/bin/sh/" folder to have the ability to execute it anywhere at the CLI.
  Then just execute it like that => "sh automate.sh".
  At this point you'll be asked to type your Github repositorie, which have to be created at the first time.
  After that you'll type the Branche on wich your project will be phushed.
  At the end you need to type the message of the commiting, which will decribe why you commit, what you add, ar whatever you want to type it.
